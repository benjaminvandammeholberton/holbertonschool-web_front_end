## Starter files
### `00-index.html`
### `00-styles.css`
### images: `/images`

## Tasks
### 0. Fix the hero banner
Because we did some changes with the `article.html` page in the previous project, our hero banner background is no more visible. Letâ€™s fix it!

But before that, to ensure we start on the same foot, you should use the starter HTML and CSS provided in the project description.

In your `01-styles.css` file
- Inside the `hero-homepage` class selector, update some values:
    - Property: `background-position`, Value: `65%` `8rem`
    - Property: `background-size`, Value: `90rem` `auto`
- Inside the selector that targets `section-inner` class inside `section-hero` class
    - Update the `min-height` to `35vh`

**Final rendering of the Hero section should look something like this**

### 1. Make the container flexible
Using the previous file as the base, in your `02-styles.css` file update the `.container` selector by changing `width` to `max-width`

If you resize your browser, you should see that the content is resizing.
